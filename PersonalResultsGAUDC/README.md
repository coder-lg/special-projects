# About this gist

So, today, I found a person([<kbd>change-agent</kbd>](https://github.com/change-agent)) telling about the fact that [<kbd>GAUDC</kbd>](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client) does allow personal requests. But it was complicated so I made a guide.

Actually, the Google Assistant SDK used by GAUDC was changed to remove personal results but by reengineering it, people in the GAUDC community figured out *how* to allow personal results.

This is the advanced guide and if you want the real one, hit [<kbd>this</kbd>](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/issues/434#issuecomment-905205632) and if you want the original, click [<kbd>here</kbd>](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/issues/53#issuecomment-875133184). Thanks to [***`morgenman`***](https://github.com/morgenman) and [***`change-agent`***](https://github.com/change-agent) for that reply that helped me to make this!
