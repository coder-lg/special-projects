# Practicing Shell Scripts

So, a few days/weeks ago, I made a shell script automator. To improve that, I am making practice in shell scripts.

The entire code was tested live on `code-server`(thanks to [`@cdr`](https://github.com/cdr) for making that) on Ubuntu 20.04.02, which is Focal Fossa LTS.

It is basically some practice on `If` commands and some new command for input named `read`.

In the next few weeks, I will be practising Shell Scripts and improve the automator *as well as* this file. Till then, ***`disappears`***
