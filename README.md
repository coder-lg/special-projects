# About this gist

This is related to the GAUDC project, which you can access [***`here`***](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client). Feel free to tell the creator a hello and about this, because I want to make this the dev branch and add the ENTIRE code there with his permission. If he allows, this script will become OFFICIAL for the project.

If you encounter any kind of glitches, feel free to open an issue [***`here`***](https://github.com/im-coder-lg/special-projects/issues/new) and templates are coming soon.

Feel free to chat in the Gitter community I made too! And this might just :boom: in the news one day too.

Yeah, and the code got revamped!
